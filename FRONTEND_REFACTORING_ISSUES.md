# Frontend Implementation Issues (Figma Design Realization)

Date: 2026-04-21
Context: Implementation pass to bring Figma design into project. Focus on design realization, not code cleanup.

## Confirmed Correctly Implemented

- Dark green plus gold visual direction is implemented and consistent with product identity.
- Sidebar navigation structure is implemented and functional.
- Trades screen contains required status filters: All, Active, Pending, Completed, Disputed.
- Trades screen includes the Create Trade primary action in the expected area.
- Empty-state handling exists when no trades are returned.
- Trade table and status chips are implemented for populated states.

## Flagged Gaps (Needs Refactor)

- Duplicate header and shell layers are rendered on Trades.
- Shell composition is inconsistent between Trades and Create Trade flows.
- Typography usage is inconsistent with design token intent.
- Root page remains template-like and not product-aligned.
- Spacing and container alignment rhythm is inconsistent across chrome and content.
- Navigation active and hover states are not fully unified.
- Surface and border token usage is mixed and not fully standardized.
- Empty state hierarchy and guidance can be improved.

## FE-REF-001 - Implement Unified App Shell Layout

Description:
Implement a single canonical app shell per Figma design. The Figma shows one top navigation and sidebar chrome serving all pages. Eliminate duplicate header/navigation layers so Trades and other pages use this consistent shell.

Requirements and Context:
- This is a frontend refactoring issue (Priority: P0).
- Scope includes layout unification between app chrome and Trades content.
- Figma Link: https://www.figma.com/design/r4l1ciQ2AnyrOxVW9t5oCm/Amana?node-id=0-1&t=1MBz2FGXTfJSQ8ma-1
- Affected files:
	- frontend/src/app/layout.tsx
	- frontend/src/components/Shell.tsx
	- frontend/src/app/trades/page.tsx

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Trades renders with exactly one top-level app chrome.
- [ ] No duplicate logo/title/nav bars remain.
- [ ] Sidebar, top bar, and content alignment are consistent.

Deliverables:
- [ ] Implementation of the above criteria.
- [ ] Proof of correct behavior (screenshots and/or QA notes).

NOTE:
This issue will not be reviewed or approved without screenshot evidence demonstrating that duplicate shell/header layers were removed.

Suggested Execution:
1. Fork and create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b refactor/fe-ref-001-single-shell-trades
```

2. In affected files, implement the shell unification:
	- frontend/src/app/layout.tsx
	- frontend/src/components/Shell.tsx
	- frontend/src/app/trades/page.tsx

3. Tests/proof required:
	- [ ] Screenshot: before Trades view with duplicate chrome
	- [ ] Screenshot: after Trades view with single canonical shell
	- [ ] Screenshot: mobile layout parity

4. Example commit message:

```bash
refactor(frontend): remove duplicate shell layers on trades page
```

Guidelines:
- Follow existing frontend conventions.
- Keep refactor scoped to layout concerns.
- Add before/after screenshots in PR.
